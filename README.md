# Rust RSS-Feed-Reader

## Motivation

I started creating this project because i couldnt find any rss reader that was capable of running as a service (on an 24/7 server) and be retrieved on an client, like transmission daemon & remote and i was an user of Lifera

## Goals

- [ ] service/daemon/server
- [ ] client
  - [ ] cli-client
  - [ ] graphical client (gtk?)
- [ ] both together
